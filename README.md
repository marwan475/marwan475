**'Computer science student'**

I am a current computer science student studying at the University Of Saskatchewan. I am highly interested in systems-level programming, network programming, cyber security, and learning different technologies/languages in general. I enjoy building projects from the ground up using as few libraries or frameworks so I can understand what's happening under the covers. I also enjoy using libraries and frameworks to build more complex projects by abstracting lower-level concepts. M
